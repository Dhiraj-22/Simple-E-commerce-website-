# React + Vite


Here is a more detailed explanation of my project:

HTML: HTML is used to create the structure of your website. This includes the layout of the pages, the navigation bar, and the different elements on each page.
CSS: CSS is used to style the elements on your website. This includes the colors, fonts, and sizes of the text, as well as the layout of the elements on the page.
JS: JS is used to add interactivity to your website. This includes things like dropdown menus, modal windows, and form validation.
React: React is a JavaScript library that is used to build user interfaces. It is very popular for building e-commerce websites because it is easy to use and it can be very scalable.
Vite: Vite is a modern JavaScript development tool that is used to build fast and efficient web applications. It is very popular for building React applications because it can significantly improve the development speed.
React framework: There are many different React frameworks that can be used to build e-commerce websites. Some popular frameworks include:
Next.js: Next.js is a React framework that is used to build server-rendered React applications. This makes it ideal for building e-commerce websites because it can improve the performance of the website.
Redux: Redux is a state management library that is used to manage the state of a React application. This is important for e-commerce websites because it allows you to keep track of things like the user's cart, their wishlist, and their checkout information.
In your project, you used React, Vite, and a React framework to build an e-commerce website. You created a minimal setup that provides a good starting point for building your own e-commerce website. You also included some ESLint rules to help you write clean and consistent code.

I hope this is helpful! Let me know if you have any other questions.
# React Vite HMR Template

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the dependencies.

npm install

Run the development server.
npm run dev

This will start a development server on port 3000. You can open your browser to http://localhost:3000 to see your app.
Features
React 18
Vite
HMR
ESLint
Usage
To use this template, simply create a new file called App.js and start coding your React app.
Here is an example of a simple React app:
import React from "react";

const App = () => {
  return <h1>Hello, world!</h1>;
};

export default App;

Development
To develop your app, you can use the following commands:
npm run dev: Starts the development server.
npm run lint: Runs ESLint to check for linting errors.
npm run test: Runs the unit tests.
Deployment
To deploy your app, you can use the following commands:
npm run build: Builds the app for production.
npm run deploy: Deploys the app to a production server.
